# Bayesian Analysis of Google Trends via Monte Carlo Markov Chain 

Final project of the course *"Statisical Methods in Data Science II"* of the Master Degree in Data Science at *Sapienza University of Rome*.

The project is a fully Bayesian analysis using MCMC of real time-series data obtained from *Google Trends* .

In the project the steps are considered:
- illustration of the dataset
-  explanation of the overall features of the statistical model, such as the role of the parameters and the inferential
goals of the analysis
- illustration of the main inferential findings (Bayesian point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing)
- discussion of one possible alternative statistical model and showcase of the results of model comparison through DIC
- illustration of the features of the MCMC convergence diagnostics and error control
